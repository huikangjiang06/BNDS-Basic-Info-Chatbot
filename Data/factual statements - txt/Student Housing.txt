The washing machines are located in the additional public bathrooms on each floor and can be used freely by students.

Each floor is also equipped with a hair dryer room. The power is cut off at 23:20. 

On the first floor of the apartment, there are also two eye-protection devices, an eye-massaging device and vision testing equipment, which encourage students to pay attention to their eyesight even when they are not studying.
